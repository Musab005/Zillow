How the website fetches data:
    - Disabling javascript didn't change anything, so no need to use Splash.
    - A XHR request was found when going to the second page of the listings. This XHR request response
        contains all the listings on the web page. Hence, no need to scrap the html. We can just use the API to
        retrieve the listings.
    - Always useful to try and find an API that fetches data. Mostly it shows up in pagination requests.
    - Double check that url response given by the script is the same as shown on the network tab on the browser.
        Otherwise, might have to add more request headers like cookies

Had to change user agent and disobey robo file to retrieve the listings.

All pagination requests are sent to the same URL "https://www.zillow.com/async-create-search-page-state"
with the same payload in the form of a query. Just that the pagination key is modified.

Adding "photos.zillowstatic.com" to allowed_domains solved the issue of downloading the images
